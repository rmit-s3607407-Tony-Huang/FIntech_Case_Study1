## What is the background of your company? 
RobinHood is an internet stock trading platform that offers unlimited ​commission free ​trading for  
* stocks in U.S. public companies,  
* ETF’s (exchange traded funds),  
* Stock options, and Cryptocurrencies


## What do they do? 
Their revenue comes from sources that other brokers might consider ancillary, 
such as 
* Lending: RobinHood can lend the idle cash in its customers’ accounts, much as a bank does. 
* RobinHood can also lend stock held in ​customers’ ​accounts (Stock lending is a big business 
* because a short sale is actually a sale of borrowed shares, so short sales cannot proceed until the relevant shares are borrowed.). 
* Margin: For a fee, RobinHood extends credit to customers to buy securities with, an arrangement 
known as “buying on margin”.

Robin hood structure takes advantage of technology to efficiently do transactions, and by doing so, can save customer on cost.

This is both a strength and weakness, as it allows newer investors to get started easily, but more advanced traders, may not have the capabilities as other platforms.
